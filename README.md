## The Poppy project history

The Poppy project was born in 2012 in the [Flowers laboratory](https://flowers.inria.fr/) at [Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux).
It was initiated during [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://github.com/matthieu-lapeyre)'s PhD Thesis surpervised by [Pierre-Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/). At the beginning, the development team was composed by [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://github.com/matthieu-lapeyre) (mechanics & design), [Pierre Rouanet](https://github.com/pierre-rouanet) (software) and [Jonathan Grizou](http://jgrizou.com/) (electronics).

This project is initially a fundamental research project financed by [ERC Grant Explorer](https://erc.europa.eu/) to explore the role of embodiement and morphology properties on cognition and especially on the learning of sensori-motor tasks.
